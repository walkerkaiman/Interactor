### Architectural Improvements for Interactor V2 (Backend Focus)

> This living document captures concrete, actionable ideas for making the backend **real-time, highly-extensible, and production-grade**.  Each item is intentionally technology-agnostic where possible so that the team can determine the best fit during implementation.

---

#### 1. Hard-Real-Time & Low-Latency Processing
1. **Event Streaming Library** – Adopt a dedicated reactive stream toolkit such as **RxJS** or **Node EventTarget + AbortSignal** to model asynchronous flows, back-pressure, throttling, and time-window operations.
2. **Binary Wire Protocol** – Swap JSON for **MessagePack / Protobuf** over WebSocket to cut payload size & encode numbers/arrays efficiently.
3. **Worker Threads / Clustering** – Route CPU-heavy or blocking I/O modules through `worker_threads` or `child_process` to keep the event loop unblocked and guarantee sub-millisecond latency for foreground traffic.
4. **Priority Queues & Deadlines** – Tag messages with priority/TTL and process via a priority queue to guarantee timely delivery of critical triggers (e.g., safety stop).

---

#### 2. First-Class Plugin System
1. **Dynamic Package Discovery**
   • Publish modules as versioned npm packages (`@interactor/module-osc-input`).
   • Backend resolves semver ranges and loads via `import()` at runtime.
2. **Isolated Sandbox** – Run third-party plugins inside a **VM Context** or **Docker micro-container** to protect the core from untrusted code.
3. **Semantic Versioning + Compatibility Matrix** – Enforce `peerDependencies` so a module declares the minimum backend API it needs.
4. **Scaffolding CLI** – Provide `npx create-interactor-module` that pre-generates manifest, tests, CI, and Typedoc skeletons.

---

#### 3. Robustness & Fault Tolerance
1. **Supervision Tree (Actor Model)** – Treat each module as an actor supervised by a parent.  Failure ➜ automatic restart with exponential back-off.
2. **Circuit-Breaker + Retry Policies** – Wrap external I/O (HTTP, serial, OSC) with configurable retry & circuit-breaker logic (e.g., [`opossum`](https://nodeshift.dev/opossum/)).
3. **Health Probes & Heartbeats** – Expose `/healthz` REST + WebSocket heartbeats so the frontend and orchestrators (Docker Swarm / Kubernetes) can detect unhealthy modules.
4. **Immutable Configuration** – Treat manifests & system config as immutable after boot; changes create a new revision to avoid runtime drift.

---

#### 4. Observability & Operations
1. **Structured Logging** – Emit ECS-compatible JSON logs → ship to ELK/Loki.
2. **Metrics** – Integrate **Prometheus/OpenMetrics** counters, gauges, and histograms (event-latency, queue length, active modules).
3. **Distributed Tracing** – Adopt **OpenTelemetry**.  Trace an OSC input through MessageRouter to a DMX output in Grafana Tempo/Jaeger.
4. **Crash Dumps & Profiling** – Automatically capture heap/node-core dumps on fatal errors for post-mortem analysis.

---

#### 5. Message Router Evolution
1. **External Broker Option** – Abstract MessageRouter to optionally persist on top of **NATS, MQTT, or Redis Streams** for horizontal scaling.
2. **Typed Topics & Schema Registry** – Enforce topic schema versions using **Avro** or **JSON-Schema** so senders/receivers stay compatible.
3. **Replay & Time-Travel** – Persist events for a configurable retention window; allow replaying streams for debugging or deterministic show re-runs.

---

#### 6. Configuration & Validation
1. **Zod / Joi Schema Validation** – Validate config at runtime with detailed error trees; surface to the UI.
2. **Dotenv & Secrets Separation** – Pull secrets/credentials from env or a vault; check-in only placeholders to git.
3. **Hot-Reload with Transactionality** – Apply config changes atomically; roll back on validation failure.

---

#### 7. Security Hardening
1. **Code Signing for Plugins** – Verify signature before loading a plugin to prevent tampering.
2. **Principal of Least Privilege** – Drop privileges (e.g., `--user=interactor`) and restrict filesystem access per module.
3. **Input Sanitization** – Centralize validation of OSC/Serial/HTTP payloads to prevent malformed data from cascading.

---

#### 8. Automated Testing & Quality Gates
1. **Contract Tests** – Generate tests from manifests so every module proves it honours its declared events & config schema.
2. **Property-Based Tests** – Use fast-check or similar to fuzz input ranges for triggers/threshold logic.
3. **CI Matrix** – Run test suites across Node LTS versions, OSes, and plugin combinations.

---

#### 9. Deployment & Scaling Strategies
1. **Containerization** – Ship official Docker images with multi-arch support; include health probes & non-root user.
2. **Kubernetes Operators** – Provide a CRD (Custom Resource Definition) so an `Interactor` graph can be deployed & managed declaratively.
3. **Edge Nodes** – Allow remote edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi sensors) to run lightweight agents that federate into the central bus via MQTT.

---

#### 10. Advanced Architectural Paradigms to Consider
1. **Event Sourcing + CQRS** – Persist every significant event and derive current state as a projection; simplifies undo/redo and time-travel.
2. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** – Encapsulate domain logic within bounded contexts (e.g., `Lighting`, `Audio`, `Control`).
3. **Hexagonal / Clean Architecture** – Decouple core business rules from external adapters (OSC, DMX, Serial) for easier testing.
4. **Finite-State Machines** – Model complex interactive behaviours using statecharts (XState) to enhance predictability.
5. **Actor Model / Akka.js** – Natural fit for isolated, message-based modules.

---

### Next Steps / Prioritisation
1. Pilot **worker thread isolation** for an existing heavy module (e.g., DMX CSV playback).
2. Integrate **Zod** config validation and expose errors via REST.
3. Add **Prometheus metrics** & **OpenTelemetry traces** to MessageRouter and ModuleLoader.
4. Design & prototype **plugin package format** with semver & code signing.
