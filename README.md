# // Interactor //

Welcome to **Interactor** - a creative platform that bridges the gap between art and technology! Whether you're an artist looking to create interactive installations or a developer wanting to build custom modules, you've come to the right place.

## What is Interactor? 

Interactor is a **modular, visual interaction system** designed for creating complex interactive art installations and experiences. Think of it as a digital canvas where you can connect different "building blocks" (modules) to create amazing interactive workflows.

### For Artists ðŸŽ­
- **Visual Node Editor**: Drag and drop to connect different modules - no coding required!
- **Real-time Control**: See your interactions come to life instantly
- **Rich Module Library**: From motion sensors to LED displays, from audio playback to network communication
- **Easy Setup**: Upload audio files, configure sensors, and create complex interactions through a friendly web interface

### For Developers ðŸ”§
- **Extensible Architecture**: Build custom modules using our robust TypeScript framework
- **Type-Safe Development**: Full TypeScript support with shared types across the entire system
- **Event-Driven Design**: Clean, decoupled architecture that's easy to understand and extend
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Built-in testing framework to ensure your modules work reliably

## Quick Start

### For Artists
1. **Start the System**: Run `npm start` in the root directory
2. **Open the Web Interface**: Navigate to the provided URL in your browser
3. **Explore Modules**: Browse available input and output modules
4. **Create Connections**: Use the visual editor to wire modules together
5. **Test & Iterate**: See your interactions in real-time!

### For Developers
1. **Setup**: `npm install` to get all dependencies
2. **Development Mode**: `npm run dev` for hot-reloading development
3. **Create a Module**: Follow our [Module Development Guide](./ModuleDevelopmentGuide.md)
4. **Test Your Work**: cd to the Tests folder and `npm test` to run the test suite. Can keep running in a seperate terminal during development.
5. **Documentation**: Check out our [TypeScript Type System Guide](./TypesGuide.md)

## What Can You Build?

### Interactive Art Installations
- **Motion-Responsive Displays**: Connect motion sensors to LED arrays or projectors
- **Audio-Visual Experiences**: Trigger sounds and visuals based on audience interaction
- **Network-Connected Installations**: Share data across multiple locations
- **Time-Based Performances**: Create scheduled or duration-based interactions

### Custom Modules
- **Input Modules**: Sensors, APIs, time triggers, network data
- **Output Modules**: Displays, speakers, motors, network endpoints
- **Processing Modules**: Data transformation, filtering, aggregation

## Architecture Overview

Interactor V2 is built around a simple but powerful concept:

```
Input Modules â†’ Message Router â†’ Output Modules
     â†“              â†“              â†“
  Sensors      Event Bus      Displays
  APIs         Real-time      Speakers  
  Triggers     Routing        Motors
```

- **Input Modules**: Capture data from the real world (sensors, APIs, time, etc.)
- **Message Router**: The "brain" that routes data between modules
- **Output Modules**: Control physical or digital outputs (displays, speakers, motors, etc.)

## Documentation Structure

- **[Module Development Guide](./ModuleDevelopmentGuide.md)**: Complete guide for creating custom modules
- **[TypeScript Type System Guide](./TypesGuide.md)**: Understanding the type system and shared interfaces
- **[Frontend Design](./FrontendDesign.md)**: UI/UX design principles and implementation details

## Getting Help

### For Artists
- Start with the visual interface - it's designed to be intuitive!
- Check the module documentation for specific features
- Most modules have built-in test functions to verify they're working

### For Developers
- Read the [Module Development Guide](./ModuleDevelopmentGuide.md) for detailed technical information
- Check the [TypeScript Type System Guide](./TypesGuide.md) for type definitions
- Look at existing modules in `backend/src/modules/` for examples
- Run tests to understand expected behavior

## Community & Contribution

We believe in the power of collaboration! Whether you're:
- **An artist** sharing your creative workflows
- **A developer** contributing new modules
- **A user** reporting bugs or suggesting features
